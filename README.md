## how to use your favorite fonts

You can use tools/mkfont_bdf to create "glyph.h".

usage: tools/mkfont_bdf ALIAS_FILE BDF1 BDF2 BDF3 ... > glyph.h

-	ALIAS_FILE: glyph substitution rule file (see table/alias)
-	BDF1, BDF2, BDF3...: bdf files
	+	yaft supports only "monospace" bdf font
	+	you can specify mulitiple bdf fonts (but these fonts MUST be the same size)
		+	If there is more than one glyph of the same codepoint, the glyph included in the FIRST bdf file is choosed

~~~
$ ./mkfont_bdf table/your_alias your/favorite/fonts.bdf > glyph.h
~~~

## build and install

*BSD users should check README.bsd

~~~
$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8 # yaft uses libc's wcwidth for calculating glyph width
$ make
# make install
or
$ make yaftx
# make installx
~~~
