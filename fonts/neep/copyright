Comment: Several additional patches and other contributions, including the
 ISO-10646-1 10x20 Neep font, were provided by Derek Upham.  Derek Upham
 has placed his modifications in the public domain.
 .
 Ben Wong contributed eight hand-drawn 10x20 runic letterforms.
 .
 The 6x13 letterforms corresponding to the 10x20 letterforms drawn by Ben
 Wong are taken from GNU unifont, released under the following license:
 All glyphs are released under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
 version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the GNU font
 embedding exception.  (Since the font embedding exception doesn't apply
 to the rest of this package, it has been elided as allowed by the font
 embedding exception.)
 .
 The glyphs for the ISO-10646-1 10x20 Neep font were taken from the
 misc-fixed font maintained by Marcus Kuhn.  Those glyphs have the
 following copyright notice:
 .
 Public domain font.  Share and enjoy.
 .
 Since these changes are all compatible with the base package license of
 GPL v2 or later, it's easiest to think of the entire contents of the
 package as covered by that license.

 I have chosen to release them under the terms of the GNU General Public
 License (GPL) version 2.0, or, at your option, any later version.  This
 means that you may freely modify and distribute these fonts, as long as
 you distribute the source code for the fonts as well.
 .
 Some few parts of these fonts are derived from the 6x13 fixed font
 accompanying the XFree86-3.3.2 distribution of the X Window System.  That
 font bears the notice "Public domain font; share and enjoy".
 .
 The vast majority of this set of fonts is original work.  Besides the
 derivations noted above, any resemblance to other fonts, copyrighted or
 not, may be accounted for by standard letter shapes and the relatively
 coarse resolution (75dpi) for which the fonts were created.
 .
 No warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including that of
 merchantibility or fitness for a particular purpose.  If anything breaks,
 you get to keep both pieces.  Your mileage may vary.  Eat your
 vegetables.
Comment: You can find the GPL version 2 in /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL-2
 on Debian systems.
